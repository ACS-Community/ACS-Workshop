Greetings!  This package is one part of the solution to allowing
Linux users to use the new Lego RCX v 2.0 with the USB tower.
This portion is a Linux kernel module which communicates with
a USB device (/dev/usb/lego0) that allows user programs access
to the lego USB tower.

Follow the instructions below to install the Linux kernel module.

The driver currently is suppored in Lejos http://www.lejos.org and a 
patched version of nqc (Not Quite C, which can be
found at the legoUSB source forge site http://legousb.sourceforge.net)
can be installed to communicate with the USB device.

This kernel module should work with kernel versions 2.4 or higher.

This driver has been provided as a courtesy by the LegoUSB DevTeam
<legousb-devteam@lists.sourceforge.net>.

Updated releases of Linux Lego USB drivers are always available from
http://legousb.sourceforge.net

-+- INSTALLATION -+-

SUGGESTION: You may wish to plug your tower in and tail -f
/var/log/messages in a seperate window to watch the tower get
initialised when you do the install.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Important!  Unplug the lego USB tower before installing the module.
After 'make install' is successfully run, then plug in the tower.
Note that 'make install' must be done as root.
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Type './configure'
* Type 'make'
* Type 'su'
* Type 'make install'

* Find a program with LegoUSB support and test it out.  Lejos and NQC are
supported; a patch for NQC is available from our website:
